# Tenova Main Repository

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts developed for
signal processing, multivariate statistical analysis, and
time--frequency-based fault detection workflows. The scripts focus on
Hotelling's T² computations, wavelet-based denoising, and time-domain
analysis.

## 📄 Script Descriptions

### **1. Hotteling_article.m**

Implements Hotelling's T² multivariate statistical analysis for fault
detection and anomaly monitoring.

### **2. Time_Analysis.m**

Performs time-domain feature extraction and signal analysis.

### **3. WaveDenoise.m**

Applies wavelet-based denoising using wavelet decomposition and
thresholding.
